  "body": "#Welcome to the Audiovista Project\r\n\r\n##An “Audiovista” is a sequence of 360° images accompanied by narration or other recorded audio.\r\n\r\nWhen it’s viewed using a virtual reality system such as a Google Cardboard headset, the Audiovista can be a powerful way to transport a viewer to a different time and place. It’s an excellent platform for many educational purposes.\r\n\r\n#Audiovista gallery\r\n\r\n#If you've made an Audiovista you'd like to add to this list, please email rzachari at andrew.cmu.edu with a link.\r\n\r\n*Audiobeesta—an exploration of beekeeping\r\n*Exploring Pittsburgh—a tour of some interesting sites and sights in Pittsburgh, PA\r\n\r\n##How to make your own!\r\n\r\nHere is a video tutorial walking through the process of using iMovie to make an Audiovista for sharing on YouTube. You will need a camera that can capture 360° images (such as a Ricoh Theta or LG 360), and some way of recording audio (a smartphone works fine for this).\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the Audiovista project was done by the Fluency Project of CREATE Lab at Carnegie Mellon University.",
